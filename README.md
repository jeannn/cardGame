# 🃏 CSI2772A - Final Project

## 📘 Overview
This project was completed as part of the **CSI2772A Programming concepts in c++** course at the **University of Ottawa**.  
It involves the design and implementation of a C++ application demonstrating key programming concepts such as **object-oriented design**, **modularity**, and **file management**.

The project required implementing multiple C++ classes (e.g., `Deck.cpp`, `Deck.h`, etc.), following strong design principles and ensuring functional correctness across all components.

## 🧩 Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implementation of multiple interacting classes with clear responsibilities.  
- **Game Logic / Deck Management:** Handles creation, shuffling, and card management logic efficiently.  
- **File I/O Operations:** Ability to save and reload the current state of the program from a file (pause functionality).  
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and exception safety.  
- **Modular Structure:** Clean separation of header (`.h`) and implementation (`.cpp`) files.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. **Compile** the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)  
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp Deck.cpp -o project
2. open the file generated jeu.exe
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play, save, or load a session.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

Object-oriented design and modular C++ programming.

File handling and persistent data storage.

Project organization, compilation, and testing workflows.
